		<p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the part of a computer system that is commonly referred to as the "brains" of a computer. The CPU is also known as the processor or microprocessor.</p>
		<img src="cpu.jpg" alt="CPU 2" border="5">
		<p>The CPU is responsible for executing a sequence of stored instructions called a program. This program will take inputs from an input device, process the input in some way and output the results to an output device.
		   CPUs aren’t only found in desktop or laptop computers, many electronic devices now rely on them for their operation. Mobile phones, DVD players and washing machines are examples of equipment that have a CPU.</p>
		<h2>Main Facts</h2>

			<li>Purpose of the CPU is to process data.</li>
			<li>Processes such as calculating, sorting and searching take place.</li>
			<li>The immediate access store is where the CPU holds all the data and programs that it is currently using.</li>

			<th><h2>Name</h2></th>
			<th><h2>What It Is</h2></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>The Control Unit</b></td>
			<td>The control unit controls and monitors communications between the hardware attached to the computer. It controls the input and output of data, checks that signals have been delivered successfully, and makes sure that data goes to the correct place at the correct time.</td> 
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Immediate Access Store</b></td>
			<td>The immediate access store is where the CPU holds all the data and programs that it is currently using. You can think of it like the numbers typed into a calculator – they are being stored inside the calculator while it processes the calculations. The immediate access store is often referred to as the registers in the CPU.</td> 
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Arithmetic And Logic Unit</b></td>
			<td>The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is where the CPU performs the arithmetic and logic operations. Every task that your computer carries out is completed here. Even typing into a word processor involves adding binary digits to the file, and then calculating which pixels on the screen should change so that you can see the characters.</td> 
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>CPU Speed</b></td>
			<td>A computer’s speed is heavily influenced by the CPU it uses. There are three main factors that affect how quickly a CPU can carry out instructions.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Clock Speed</b></td>
			<td>CPUs can only carry out one instruction at a time.
			    It might seem like CPUs can perform many instructions simultaneously, since it is possible for you to do homework, read instant messages and listen to music at the same time. However, the CPU is able to carry out instructions at such speed that it can seem like it is simultaneous.
The speed at which the CPU can carry out instructions is called the clock speed. This is controlled by a clock. With every tick of the clock, the CPU fetches and executes one instruction. The clock speed is measured in cycles per second, and one cycle per second is known as 1 hertz. This means that a CPU with a clock speed of 2 gigahertz (GHz) can carry out two thousand million (or two billion) cycles per second.
The higher the clock speed a CPU has, the faster it can process instructions.</td> 
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Cores</b></td>
			<td>A CPU is traditionally made up of a processor with a single core. Most modern CPUs have two, four or even more cores.
A CPU with two cores, called a dual core processor, is like having two processors in one. A dual core processor can fetch and execute two instructions in the same time it takes a single core processor to fetch and execute just one instruction. A quad core processor has four cores and can carry out even more instructions in the same period of time. The main downside of using quad core processors is that they are more expensive to design and make, and they also use more power than single or dual core processors. Another disadvantage is that the instructions have to be split up to decide which core will execute them and the results have to be merged together again at the end, which slows the processor down a little.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Cache</b></td>
			<td>A cache (pronounced ‘cash’) is a tiny block of memory built right onto the processor. The most commonly used instructions and data are stored in the cache so that they are close at hand. The bigger the cache is, the more quickly the commonly used instructions and data can be brought into the processor and used.</td>
